# NewEngland
This is a final project I worked on with 2 other people, Nick Ciccio and April McBroom.
For this project we designed a website that is meant to attract people to the New England area.

The website consists of a Home, Historical page of historical sites, Cultural page of cultural attactions, Sports page of sports attraction, Educational page of Universities, Tourism page of tourists attraction, and a Contact page. As our website is meant to be exclusive, the first website they see is the login page requesting username and password. If the user enters a username and password which is stored in the "Login" page they will be redirected to our index.html page wich is our home. If the user is not registered, they can click  the "Register" button on the bottom right which will take them to the Registration page where they will be redirected to the Home page once registered (all informaion is stored in "Login"). The Historical page allows users to order adult and/or child tickets (up to 10 adult and 10 child tickets per order) for each historical site, with their order being stored in a database table named"Historical". 


Please Note: 
  All images were not taken/made by me and belong to their respectives owners
  HTML files with "quiz" in their names are quizzes that will be displayed when the user opens them on the Educational Page
  The programming languagues used are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MYSQL, and ExpressJS.
